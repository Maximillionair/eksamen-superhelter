## Architecture Highlights

The application follows a modern MVC architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│             │     │             │     │             │
│  Frontend   │────►│  Backend    │────►│  Database   │
│  (Views)    │     │ (Controllers│     │  (Models)   │
│             │◄────│  & Services)│◄────│             │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

Key architectural decisions:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic encapsulated in service modules
3. **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstracted through models
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Project Status
