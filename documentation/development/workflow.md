# Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended development workflow and practices for the Superhero Application. It provides guidelines for code organization, Git workflow, testing procedures, and deployment processes.

## Development Cycle

The development process follows these key stages:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│    Plan     │─────►│  Develop    │─────►│    Test     │─────►│   Deploy    │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
       ▲                                                             │
       │                                                             │
       └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              Feedback & Iteration
```

### 1. Planning Phase

Before writing code:

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Clearly define the feature or bug fix
   - Document acceptance criteria
   - Identify affected components

2. **Task Breakdown**
   - Break down complex features into manageable tasks
   - Estimate effort required
   - Identify dependencies

3. **Architecture Planning**
   - Consider how changes affect existing architecture
   - Plan necessary model/schema changes
   - Identify potential performance impacts

### 2. Development Phase

#### Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

```
           ┌───── feature/user-profile
           │
           │                 ┌───── feature/search
main ──────┼─────────────────┼──────────────── main
           │                 │
           └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   # Start from updated main branch
   git checkout main
   git pull
   
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   ```

2. **Committing Changes**
   - Commit frequently with meaningful messages
   - Follow conventional commit format:
     ```
     feat: add favorite reason functionality
     fix: resolve issue with hero image loading
     docs: update API documentation
     refactor: improve error handling in auth controller
     ```

3. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established project structure
   - Place new components in appropriate directories
   - Maintain separation of concerns

#### Coding Standards

1. **General Guidelines**
   - Use consistent 2-space indentation
   - Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions)
   - Add JSDoc comments for functions
   - Keep functions small and focused

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Use Bootstrap classes for consistent styling
   - Add custom CSS in the appropriate files
   - Follow responsive design principles
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

3. **Backend Development**
   - Follow MVC pattern
   - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Document API endpoints

### 3. Testing Phase

#### Manual Testing

For each feature or bug fix:

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Test with different user roles (if applicable)
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Verify mobile responsiveness

3. **Database Testing**
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check MongoDB operations
   - Validate schema updates

#### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully

- [ ] Database operations maintain data integrity
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

### 4. Code Review Process

Before merging:

1. **Self-review**
   - Review your own changes for quality
   - Run linting and fix issues
   - Remove debugging code

2. **Peer Review**
   - Request review from team members
   - Address review comments
   - Explain complex implementation decisions

3. **Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Code follows project standards
   - [ ] Appropriate test coverage
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] No unnecessary dependencies
   - [ ] Performance considerations addressed
   - [ ] Security concerns addressed

### 5. Deployment Process

#### Staging Deployment

1. **Preparation**
   - Merge feature branch to development branch
   - Verify integration with other features
   - Run full test suite

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Verify functionality in staging
   - Check for any environment-specific issues

#### Production Deployment

1. **Release Planning**
   - Document changes in release notes
   - Plan deployment timing
   - Prepare rollback plan

2. **Deployment Steps**
   - Merge to main branch
   - Tag the release version
   - Deploy to production

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Monitor for errors
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Address any immediate issues

## Continuous Integration

While we don't currently have formal CI/CD, here are recommended practices:

1. **Pre-commit Checks**
   - Run linting: `eslint .`
   - Check for security issues: `npm audit`

2. **Manual Integration Testing**
   - Regular integration of features to development branch
   - Regular testing of integrated features

## Handling Technical Debt

1. **Identification**
   - Document known technical debt
   - Label issues appropriately
   - Track in project management tool

2. **Prioritization**
   - Evaluate impact and effort
   - Schedule debt reduction alongside features
   - Address critical debt promptly

3. **Refactoring**
   - Allocate time for regular refactoring
   - Write tests before refactoring
   - Document improvements

## Documentation Practices

Keep documentation updated:

1. **Code Documentation**
   - JSDoc comments for functions
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - README updates for new features

2. **API Documentation**
   - Update API endpoints documentation
   - Document request/response formats
   - Include example requests

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Update diagrams for significant changes
   - Document design decisions
   - Keep security documentation current

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Optimize queries for performance
   - Use projection to limit returned fields

2. **Frontend Performance**
   - Optimize image sizes
   - Minimize unnecessary DOM operations
   - Use pagination for large data sets

3. **Monitoring**
   - Watch for slow API responses
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Track page load times

## Security Practices

Incorporate security throughout development:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Properly protect routes
   - Validate permissions
   - Use secure session handling

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before storage or display
   - Prevent injection attacks

3. **Dependency Security**
   - Regularly run `npm audit`
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Review new dependencies for security

## Version Control Best Practices

1. **Branch Management**
   - Keep branches short-lived
   - Regularly sync with main branch
   - Delete merged branches

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Keep commits focused on single changes
   - Reference issue numbers in commits

3. **Git Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Set up user information
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   
   # Set up helpful aliases
   git config --global alias.st status
   git config --global alias.co checkout
   git config --global alias.br branch
   ```

## Code Hygiene

   - Callback hell / poor async patterns

## Communication Guidelines

Maintain effective team communication:

1. **Issue Tracking**
   - Use GitHub Issues or similar
   - Tag issues appropriately
   - Link commits to issues

2. **Status Updates**
   - Regular progress reports
   - Flag blocking issues early
